# OTP_Verifcation
I went a level up with doing this Project.
This project uses smtplib library for sending OTPs via mail and along with random and tkinter for generating OTP and providing GUI respectively.
The project uses sender's email id and password for login purpose thereby sending OTP to the recievers email id.
You might have to "Add Password" to your google account for enabling the compiler to log into your account.
Finally entering the recieved OTP which is compared to the sent OTP and verification is done accordingly and that's it.
